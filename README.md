Computer Graphics
==========

Some of the coursework I've done for a computer graphics course I took at NYU, taught by Ken Perlin. Projects include writing WebGL shaders using GLSL, implementing the Phong reflectance algorithm and implementing matrix operations for animation. You could access the projects [here](http://chrisjimenez.github.io/computergraphics/).
