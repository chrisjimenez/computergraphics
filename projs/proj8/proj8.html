          For this experiment I was trying to mimic a wave motion using circles. This was a very simple implementation, basically looping through the inner canvas and creating a circle with a radius dependent on midpoint of the canvas. that is, the farther the circle is from the midpoint, the smaller the ir radii becomes. But you can see that as you get farther from the midpoint, the circles begin to increase in radii again.
