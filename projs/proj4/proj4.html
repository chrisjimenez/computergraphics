          For this assignment, I passed the sphere coordinates and their corresponding colors using arrays. This was simply an assignment to play with the functionality. This time, there are 4 spheres instead of 2 spheres from the previous assignment. The farther away they're from the middle of the canvas, the more distorted they became, as seen with the pink sphere.
