          For this assignment, we rendered different shapes by creating a list of vertices and creating triangular faces out of those vertices. So for every three vertices in the list of vertices, I created a triangle and rendered it on to the canvas. This was done for several shapes including a cube, octahedron, cylinder, sphere and torus.
