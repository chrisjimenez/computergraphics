          For this assignment, a basic implementation of a ray tracer was done. The ray origin is located in the middle of the 640x640 canvas, which is (320.0, 320.0, focalLength), where the focal length is currently 100.0. Using the formula given in lecture, I calcualted the distance along the ray from the ray origin to all the pixels in the canvas. If the ray hits one of the spheres, then it would display their respective colors. But if the ray missed the spheres completely, it would return a large number.
