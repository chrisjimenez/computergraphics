        <p>
          For this assignment, I implemented the Phong relfectance algorithm to replicate when lights hit a spherical surface. In this implementation, I took three components in to consideration for EACH sphere--ambient, diffuse and specularity. The three components were also calculated for each light source. The combination creates the reflecting effect seen on the spheres. 
        </p>

        <p>
          There are 2 light sources in this scene and 4 spheres. Each light source has the same color--white. But as they hit the spherical surfaces, their effect on them is dependent on the ambient, diffuse and specularity properties of the spheres material.
