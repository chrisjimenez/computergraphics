          For this assignment, the task was to create a bunch of different shapes inside the canvas for practice when we eventually do ray tracing. I decided to do three simple shapes -- a circle, a square and hexagons. The hardest, of course, was creating the hexagons. But by simply getting three sets  of 2D vectors, I was able to set it up.

        <p>
          For animation, I decided to have the square move up and down vertically while having the circle just move up and own in the center. The function I used to make the hexagons "fly" away from the screen is the tan() function. Had I used the sin() or cos(), the hexagons would be moving back and forth within the canvas.
