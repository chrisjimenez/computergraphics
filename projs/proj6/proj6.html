          For this assignment, the Phong reflectance algorithm from the previous assignment was used except this time, ray reflectance was considered. When a ray shot from the ray origin and hits a sphere at a specific sphere coordinate, that will create a reflecting ray shooting outward where the ray origin is. This is repeated a number of times which creates a mirror effect on the spheres. So you can actually see the other spheres reflection on all the spheres. You could even see the two light sources! The pattern seen on the spheres is the result of the combination of a noise function and a turbulance function with the ambient and diffuse component of each sphere.
