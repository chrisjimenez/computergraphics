          Given the sample code from class, which could be found <a href="http://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/courses/fall2014/code2.zip">here</a>, I left the vector shader alone and only wrote code for the fragment shader. Firstly, I used the built in gl_FragCoord variable to get the x and y values of the current pixel/fragment location. Then I created a variable x which is the sum of the x component of the mouse location and current pixel/fragment location. I did the same for the variable y.
        </p>
  	
    		<p>
    		  Once I got the x and y values, I squared them and used the sin() function and mod() function to create a looping effect. Then I set gl_FragColor to the result. The result is what appears to be a bunch of small circles pulsating. As you step back, you could see that these smaller circles actually make up four larger circles.
    		</p>

    		<p>
    		  The pulsating effect comes from using the mod() function with u_time(the current time) as my dividend. I noticed that when I increased the divisor, the pulsating effect increases, which is pretty cool.
